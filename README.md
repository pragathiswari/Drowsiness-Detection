# Drowsiness-Detection
This project detects drowsiness in real-time using a webcam. It uses Python, OpenCV, and Dlib/Mediapipe to track eye movement by calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). If eyes remain closed for too long, an alarm is triggered, helping prevent accidents due to driver fatigue.
